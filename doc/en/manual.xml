    <abstract>
      <para>Pymprovisator is a program for jazz musicians. Jazz music
      is based on improvising and this program helps to the
      improvisator.
	The user sets the song's parameters (title, style, bars
      number, chord sequence, etc.) and the program generates
      a MIDI file with an appropiated accompainment.</para>

      <para>This program was inspired by PG Music's Band in a Box
      software and the CD+Book sets from Jamey Aebersold.</para>

      <para>Pymprovisator can run on any computer and any operating
      system capable of run the Python programming
      language. Pymprovisator has been tested on Windows boxes (98, NT
	and 2000), Linux (RedHat, Debian and Mandrake), FreeBSD and
      BeOS.</para>

      <para>This program is free software, open source, GPL
	licensed. See the LICENSE.TXT file for more details.</para>

      <para><productname>Pymprovisator</productname> has two modes:
      command line or graphic user interface. In command line mode,
      the program reads a song file and produces the corresponding
      MIDI file. You can learn more about the song file format below
      (<xref linkend="song"/>). </para>

      <section id="command">
	<title>Command line usage</title>
      <para>Using the program in command line mode is very easy. You
	  call the program and pass the location of a
      <productname>pymprovisator</productname> song. The program will
      generate a MIDI file and will launch your prefered MIDI
      player. Look this example:
<screen>
python pymprovisator.py  examples/test_song.ymp
Executing: /usr/bin/abc2midi "/tmp/@6691.0.abc" -o "/home/david/pymprovisator/examples/ThisIsAnotherTestSong.mid"
MIDI file saved on /home/david/pymprovisator/examples/ThisIsAnotherTestSong.mid
Executing: /usr/bin/playmidi -e "/home/david/pymprovisator/examples/ThisIsAnotherTestSong.mid"
Playmidi 2.4 Copyright (C) 1994-1997 Nathan I. Laredo, AWE32 by Takashi Iwai
This is free software with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
For details please see the file COPYING.</screen>
The program reads the song, generates an temporary file with .abc
	  extension and using the auxiliar program
	  <productname>abc2midi</productname> generates the MIDI
	  file. Finally, launches your prefered MIDI player (playmidi
	  in this example).</para>

      <para>In order to a correct operation, your
	  <productname>Pymprovisator</productname> configuration file must be
	  present and must specify the correct path to the auxiliary
	  programs (<productname>abc2midi</productname> and your
	  prefered MIDI player). You can learn how to install your
	  configuration file below (<xref linkend="config"/>).</para>

	<para> <productname>Pymprovisator</productname> offers more
	  options in command line mode: <keysym>-h</keysym>, show a
	  short help message; <keysym>-c</keysym>, show the available
	  chord that <productname>Pymprovisator</productname> can
	  manage; <keysym>-s</keysym>, create a basic config file in
	  your HOME directory. See below (<xref linkend="config"/>).
</para>
      </section>
      <section id="gui">
	<title>Graphical user interface usage</title>
	<para>In order to run <productname>Pymprovisator</productname>
	with graphical user interface, call the program with the
	option <keysym>-g</keysym> or <keysym>--gui</keysym>.  You may
	specify the path to a song file and the program will load the
	song on startup:<screen>
python pymprovisator.py  -g examples/test_song.ymp
Using song file: '/home/david/pymprovisator/examples/test_song.ymp'
</screen>
    (There is another way: executing the script
    <command>pymprovisator.pyw</command>, in that case, you do not
    need pass the <keysym>-g</keysym> or
    <keysym>--gui</keysym> options, neither the path to a song). 
    You will see a window showing all the parameters of a song: 
    title, style, key, bars number, etc.).

    <title>Song's format</title>
    <para><productname>Pymprovisator</productname> uses a format very
    similar to .ini files. A pymprovisator song starts with a header
    <command>[SONG]</command> and more lines describing the song's parameters:
      <screen>
[SONG]
# This is an example song
id = ThisIsATestSong
tempo = 153
n_choruses = 10
title = This is a test song
key = C
n_bars = 12
active_instruments = piano bass drums
style = basic
chords = 4c7 4f7 8c7 8f7 8c7 4g7 4f7 4c7 4g7
</screen></para>
    <para>In this example you can see all the elements that makes a
      song. By default, <productname>Pymprovisator</productname> songs
      are saved with <command>.ymp</command> extension, but you can
      use another extension. Let's see all the elements:
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>id</emphasis> Text, without spaces or
	    puctuation signs. Identifies the song and it's used when
	    generating the MIDI files.</para> 
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>tempo</emphasis> Indicates the song speed or
	   ticks per minute. It must be a numerical value, integer,
	   greater than 0. 
	  </para> 
	</listitem>

	  <para><emphasis>n_choruses</emphasis> Number of choruses to

	  G#m, Abm, Am, A#m, Bbm and Bm</para> 
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>n_bars</emphasis> Number of bars or
	  measures. Integer greater than 0.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>active_instruments</emphasis> Indicates
	    which instruments will be used in the song. At least one
	    of this: "piano", "bass" or "drums" (don't type the quotes).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>style</emphasis> Song style. This styles are
	    defined: swing, even_eights, jazz_waltz, waltz,
	    five_swing, five, latin1, latin2, bossa, samba, ballad,
	    funk, rock y basic. 
	    We don't describe them: their names must be very
	    descriptive!. </para> 

	  <para>All styles are in 4/4 meter, except waltz and
	  jazz_waltz, in 3/4 and five and five_swing, in 5/4.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para><emphasis>chords</emphasis> Song's chord sequence,
	    spaciated with  blank spaces. The chords are written in
	    standard jazz notation, and each of one is preceded by a
	    number especifing the number of beats or duration of the
	    chord, even if the chord is ocupping one beat.</para>

	  <para>Very important: the chords sequence must be coherent
	    with the measures number. Thus, in the given example, we
	    find 12 bars, in 'basic' style (4/4). Our song has 48
	    beats (12x4). Comprobation: 
           4 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 48 beats. That's
	    OK!.</para>   
	</listitem>
       </itemizedlist>
      The order of this lines is not mandatory, but all parameters are
      needed. You can 
      write comments in your song files by typing an sharp simbol (#)
      at the start of a line, like the example (<computeroutput># This
      is an example song ...</computeroutput>).

    <title>The configuration file</title>

    <para>In order to grant a proper running, you need a configuration

    <para>If you use the command line version, you have two options.
 </para>
<para>First and easiest: run the program with the option -s:
<screen>
python pymprovisator.py -s
</screen>
This command will create in your HOME directory a configuration file
      that you have to edit and adjust to your system (see below).
</para>
<para>
Second, more difficult:
Copy to your HOME directory the sample configuration file provided in     
the directory <command>pymprovisator/examples/</command> with this command:
<screen>
cp pymprovisator/examples/pymprovisator.conf.example ~/.pymprovisator.conf
</screen>
When you have created your configuration file, you have to edit and
      adjust to your preferences. Don't erase any line: the program
      will not run properly:

    <para>
In [PREFERED_INSTRUMENTS] section, you have to write the full name

    </para>
    <para>
In [PREFERED_VOLUME] section, you have to write a numerical value,
      integer, greater than 0 and less than 128.
</para>
    <para>Finally, en [PATHS] section you have to write the full path
    to your auxiliary programs ( <command>abc2midi</command> and a
    MIDI player). Remember: there are some precompiled versions of
    <command>abc2midi</command> in the directory
    <command>pymprovisator/exes</command>. Look at this directory
    before download anything. The abcMIDI's page is in (<ulink

    You can download abc2midi from this location.

              <para>We can't be sure, this locations may be overriden

python pymprovisator.py -s
